    "# Chapter 41 -  Functions\n",
    "#### Often times, you have to run a set of code more than once to do a specific function\n",
    "#### For example. If you have a set of code that takes input, calculates the sum of the two numbers and prints the sum\n",
    "#### Now, if we want to run it more than once at different parts of our program, we can definitely write all these lines again and again. But that will make our code unnecessarily long and thus harder for us to debug in case of any error.\n",
    "#### Functions are a way to represent a set of line of codes by one name that you can use later. \n",
    "#### So in above example, we can simply create a function called get_sum and write lines of code in there. Now, instead of writing sets of code everywhere, we simply write a small function name. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax:\n",
    "* Function is defined as follows:\n",
    "            def function_name(arguments):\n",
    "                write commands indented\n",
    "                this is second command\n",
    "                return is optional keyword that is used at the end to return results\n",
    "            And this is the regular code outside function\n",
    "            \n",
    "#### Function Syntax discussion:\n",
    "* The keyword def is used to define a funciton\n",
    "* The def keyword is always followed by a function name, which is followed by parenthesis. Notice there is a colon at the end of first line. \n",
    "* All commands inside function must be indented by 1 tab. Just as we did for For loop.\n",
    "* The \"return\" is a keyword that we'll discuss later.\n",

    "* Previously we saw for loops which we have been using alot in our examples. For loop used to have an initial value to start with, and a final value to go to and it used to run for a specific number of times. \n",
    "* Simularly, for loops can run through a list, a dictionary, etc. \n",
    "* If you wanted to end the loop due to some condition, you used break there. \n",
    "* Similarly, to skip an iteration, you used continue function. \n",
    "* While loops are a bit different from For loop. They take in a condition and check that condition to meet no matter how many loops it takes. Once the condition is met, the while loop ends. \n",
    "* This loop is good for the conditions when you dont know exactly how many times the loop would run. \n",
    "* Examples are if you are taking input from user and until user presses a particular button, you keep on taking inputs."
